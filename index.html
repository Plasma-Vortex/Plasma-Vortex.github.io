	I'm a math contest enthusiast, competitive programmer, and avid learner of anything that piques my curiousity. I'm also contestant <a href="http://imo-official.org/year_reg_team.aspx?year=2018&code=CAN">CAN6</a> at IMO 2018. You can learn more <a href="/about-me/">about me</a>, see my <a href="/projects/">projects</a>, or read my <a href="/math/">math handouts</a>.
