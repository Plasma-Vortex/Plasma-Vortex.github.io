	I'm a math contest enthusiast, competitive programmer, and avid learner of anything that piques my curiousity. I'm also proud to be on <a href="https://cms.math.ca/Competitions/IMO/">Canada's IMO 2018 team</a>. You can learn more <a href="/about-me/">about me</a>, see my <a href="/projects/">projects</a>, or read my <a href="/math/">math handouts</a>.
