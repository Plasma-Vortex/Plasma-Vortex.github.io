	I'm a math contest enthusiast, competitive programmer, and avid learner of anything that piques my curiousity. I'm also proud to have competed at the <a href="https://www.imo-official.org/participant_r.aspx?id=28475">2018 International Math Olympiad</a> as part of <a href="https://cms.math.ca/Competitions/IMO/">Math Team Canada</a>. You can learn more <a href="/about-me/">about me</a>, see my <a href="/projects/">projects</a>, or read my <a href="/math/">math handouts</a>.
