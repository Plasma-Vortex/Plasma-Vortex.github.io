<p>
	(test) I'm a math contest enthusiast, competitive programmer, and avid learner of anything that piques my curiousity. In grade 8, I found out about the International Math Olympiad, and ever since then it's been my goal to be on Canada's IMO team. You can learn more <a href="/about-me/">about me</a>, or see my <a href="/projects/">projects</a>.
