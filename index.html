	## About Me
	I'm a math contest enthusiast, compeitive programmer, and avid learner of anything that piques my curiousity. Currently, my biggest goal is to qualify for the International Math Olympiad.

	## Projects
	These are some projects which I've enjoyed working on. It may be short now, but I plan to change that!
	
	#### Spawn
	Spawn is a game created by me and Steven Mai. Download it on the Google Play Store [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.StevenAndHoward.Spawn)!
